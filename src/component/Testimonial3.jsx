      Having a handbook to explain things and give me exercises and a place to write has been amazing. The quality of this book is better than any help book I've bought. The time it arrived was amazing â€” in less than a week I received this treasure to dive into, without the long wait time. I'm suggesting this for gifts for the upcoming holiday season to buy.
